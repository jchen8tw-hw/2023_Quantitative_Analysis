summary(HMDA)

# The variable we are interested in modelling is "deny", an indicator for whether an applicant??s mortgage application has
# been accepted (deny = no) or denied (deny = yes). A regressor that ought to have power in explaining whether a mortgage
# application has been denied is "pirat", the applicant??s payment to income ratio.

# convert 'deny' to numeric
HMDA$deny <- as.numeric(HMDA$deny) - 1 # Note that as.numeric(HMDA$deny) will turn deny = no into "deny = 1" and deny = yes into "deny = 2",
# so using as.numeric(HMDA$deny)-1 we obtain the binary values 0 and 1.

# very different from what linear probability model estimated.
